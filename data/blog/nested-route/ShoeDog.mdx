# The NIKE story

![Nike_Banner](/static/images/nike1.jpg)

Phil Knight was passionate about creating an athletic life for each individual. He brought athleticism to each individual by creating something that makes you run, play or just be yourself `The NIKE`.

## Motive

Phil Knight had an obsession for shoes, it was all natural because he himself was an athlete. He had a great coach named Bowerman, who was a shoe dog and designed shoes for all his players, analyzing their strengths and needs.

## The Journey

Phil was moved by the quality, Japanese had in their production and began to sell shoes purchased from Onitsuka, a Japanese firm. He made a company called “Blue Ribbon”, that traded shoes in the American market. Things were really going well until the Japanese chose to find another organized and influential firm for distribution, though they were obliged to be with “Blue Ribbon”, bound by the contract.

Phil, seeing this as a threat, started to look for better options and started the company “NIKE INC”. A challenge is but an opportunity to grow. Learning from the mistakes of the past, he never depended on a single player for shoes.

He initially traded shoes made by other manufacturers with his brand name. As the top line bloomed, he transitioned into manufacturing.

## Challenges

One of the greatest challenges was managing cash flows. When there is a huge growth rate, entrepreneurs pump more and more money into the business and get stuck with cash flows. There was a time NIKE had no money to pay back it’s installments and were accused of window dressing, however luck favored and they escaped from this problem, thanks to NISHO bank.

## X-Factors

NIKE’s success may be attributed to the passionate top management it had: Phil to begin with, Hayes, Johnson, Strasser, Woodell. All of them were either accountants or lawyers. Accountants were counting while the lawyers layered the sales. Each of them was as passionate as Phil and thus growth was possible for NIKE.

Phil also remembers the athletes who supported and were supported by NIKE. Starting from Pre, ranging up to Tiger, Jordan, Kobe, Sampras etc. Each of them had a personal connection with the brand and were into it. It was more than business for them.

## Some interesting facts.

1.             The name NIKE was suggested by Woodell, and Phil chose this name at the last moment and even while announcing the name, he had other names like “Dimension Six”,”Falcon”,"Bengal" etc running in his head.
2.             Phil went on for a world tour, prior to starting his brand. It is important to understand the society and then start ventures.
3.             Phil did other jobs like accounting, teaching whenever there was a dip in sales during his blue-ribbon days. Wise always mitigate risk.
4.             NIKE had many times when they thought they were insolvent, but they were able to beat all downside and rise up. The game is never lost until its really lost.
5.             Sport advertisements brought most of the sales for them. Thus, they went into supporting athletes from all spheres.

## Post Success

    Phil wanted to start all over and redo everything after gaining this vast experience. He was deeply passionate about philanthropy and girl welfare across the globe.

    His regrets were not spending enough time with his family and not speaking to a few people post parting ways, despite their prior friendship.
