![Nike_Banner](/static/images/nike1.jpg)

Phil Knight was passionate about creating an athletic life for each individual. He brought athleticism to each individual by creating something that makes you run, play or just be yourself `The NIKE`.

## <mark className='bg-blue-500 p-1 rounded-md'>Motive</mark>

Phil Knight had an obsession for shoes, it was all natural because he himself was an athlete. He had a great coach named Bowerman, who was a shoe dog and designed shoes for all his players, analyzing their strengths and needs.

## <mark className='bg-blue-500 p-1 rounded-md'>The Journey</mark>

Phil was moved by the quality, Japanese had in their production and began to sell shoes purchased from Onitsuka, a Japanese firm. He made a company called “Blue Ribbon”, that traded shoes in the American market. Things were really going well until the Japanese chose to find another organized and influential firm for distribution, though they were obliged to be with “Blue Ribbon”, bound by the contract.

Phil, seeing this as a threat, started to look for better options and started the company “NIKE INC”. A challenge is but an opportunity to grow. Learning from the mistakes of the past, he never depended on a single player for shoes.

He initially traded shoes made by other manufacturers with his brand name. As the top line bloomed, he transitioned into manufacturing.

## <mark className='bg-blue-500 p-1 rounded-md'>Challenges</mark>

One of the greatest challenges was managing cash flows. When there is a huge growth rate, entrepreneurs pump more and more money into the business and get stuck with cash flows. There was a time NIKE had no money to pay back it’s installments and were accused of window dressing, however luck favored and they escaped from this problem, thanks to NISHO bank.

## <mark className='bg-blue-500 p-1 rounded-md'>X-Factors</mark>

NIKE’s success may be attributed to the passionate top management it had: Phil to begin with, Hayes, Johnson, Strasser, Woodell. All of them were either accountants or lawyers. Accounts were counting while the lawyers layered the sales. Each of them was as passionate as Phil and thus growth was possible for NIKE.

Phil also remembers the athletes who supported and were supported by NIKE. Starting from Pre, ranging up to Tiger, Jordan, Kobe, Sampras etc. Each of them had a personal connection with the brand and were into it. It was more than business for them.

## <mark className='bg-blue-500 p-1 rounded-md'>Some interesting facts.</mark>

1.             The name NIKE was suggested by Woodell, and Phil chose this name at the last moment and even while announcing the name, he had other names like “Dimension Six”,”Falcon”,"Bengal" etc running in his head.
