You probably heard about the growing prices of real estate properties across the fast-growing cities. You may want to buy some property and benefit from the bullish run that's currently happening in the Real Estate Sector, especially in the cities.

Nonetheless, the common man in India feels a burden in his pockets, when it comes to buying a property or an immovable asset.

The concept of fractional properties has risen to solve the problem of the high cost of investing in real estate properties.

Well, this is probably the right time to talk about: [REIT]().

Yes, the solution to the above-described scenario is a REIT.

You probably were able to buy a portion of companies through shares listed on the stock markets, similarly, you can invest in a REIT, on an exhange, and gain from the bullish Real Estate.

Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) is a pool of money, that is collected by Real Estate corporates and is plowed into the construction of properties for leasing.

The Lease / Rent may be given back to the investors at a later date like a dividend.

Well, a prudent investor will never invest in a REIT because of the dividend or yearly returns, it will barely be 7-8 %, as is the the return on renting properties.

However, the REIT will appreciate and grow fast because of the property appreciation that happens rapidly.

So if you are bullish on Real Estate and want to invest in smaller lots, REITs may be the viable solution for you.

A Little will make a Lot...

That's what a REIT is all about.
