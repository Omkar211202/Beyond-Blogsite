# The NIKE story

![Nike_Banner](/static/images/nike1.jpg)

Phil Knight was an amateur athelete himself. Madness for running instilled in him the passion to wear the best shoes that gave the zeal and comfort to run more. Sorry then, nothing existed. Thus, his pursuit to find something he wanted, led to the formation of the world's best running brand NIKE.

## His Initial Struggles

Simplify create multiple folders inside the main `/data/blog` folder and add your `.md`/`.mdx` files to them. You can even create something like `/data/blog/nested-route/deeply-nested-route/my-post.md`

We use Next.js catch all routes to handle the routing and path creations.

## Use Cases

Here are some reasons to use nested routes

- More logical content organisation (blogs will still be displayed based on the created date)
- Multi-part posts
- Different sub-routes for each author
- Internationalization (though it would be recommended to use [Next.js built-in i8n routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing))

## Note

- The previous/next post links at bottom of the template are currently sorted by date. One could explore modifying the template to refer the reader to the previous/next post in the series, rather than by date.
