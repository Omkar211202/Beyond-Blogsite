## <mark className='bg-white p-1 rounded-md'>Background</mark>

The World War 1 kicked off after the assassination of Austrian [Archduke Franz Ferdinand ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria) on 28 June 1914. After this, there were different tensions amidst countries that led to the formation of the:

1.  	<mark className='bg-slate-500 p-1 rounded-md'>Central Powers</mark>: Germany, Austria – Hungary and Turkey.
2.  	<mark className='bg-slate-500 p-1 rounded-md'>Allies</mark>: France, Great Britain, Russia, Italy, Japan.

The US abstained from entering the war, it was this mandate of the people that got [Woodrow Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson) to win the elections. Germany taking advantage of this, bombed several ships, merchant and passenger ships, where many US citizens died. Still, the US abstained from war, knowing well the havoc and loss it would create.

While the world war was still brewing up and countries were choosing sides, Germany wanted Mexico to side with them in the war. Thus, the then secretary Zimmermann posted a telegraph to a German ambassador [Henrich von Eckardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_von_Eckardt), who was in Mexico. However, this message had to go through the American lines to reach Mexico, as the British destroyed the German cable lines.

The telegraph asked Mexico to side with Germany in the war, once the US entered the war. 
In return, Germany will help them back to get back Texas, and Arizona from the US. 
This message was directed to the German ambassador in Mexico, to work out the diplomacy.

The main reason for asking Mexico to pick a war with the US was to decrease the supply of arms, exported from the US, 
since the home country would be at war. This would turn out to be a strategic win for Germany over the Allies.

## <mark className='bg-white p-1 rounded-md'>The Britisher’s Dilemma.</mark>

The Brits were the first ones to decode this message. They found that the US was in danger if the telegraph became a reality. However, they were not able to convey this information to the US because they got it stealthily, by reading all messages between the US and other countries, nor could they hold back from telling their allies.

## <mark className='bg-white p-1 rounded-md'>The Brits Plan</mark>
The British planned for a spy to get the information in Mexico and then reveal it to the US, keeping the tracks clean, though it was not. They executed the same and conveyed it to the US.

## <mark className='bg-white p-1 rounded-md'>The Entry of the US into World War 1.</mark>
Though the president of the US became well aware of this news, he still tried to abstain from war. However, when the people of America learned about this cunning plan, they changed their view and wanted war. Ambassador Henrich also agreed that this telegram incident was true, and blamed the US for security and privacy breaches.

 
## <mark className='bg-white p-1 rounded-md'>Could the US be prevented from entering the war??</mark>
Yes, the US could be prevented from entering the war. The key role was in the hands of Henrich, who could have lied. He could also blame the code breaker of England for the wrong interpretation of the cryptic code. Alas, this did not happen.

`World War 1 thus became a sad reality, post the US entry.`
