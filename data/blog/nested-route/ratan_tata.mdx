Many think that Ratan Tata was a great business man, who took the Tata group from a revenue of **USD 5.8 billion** to **USD 85 billion** in 2011, while he was still the chairman of the group.
It was he who played a pivot role in the development of TCS, growth of Tata motors, expansion of group operations and markets to an international scale.

His famous acquisitions include **Tetley Tea, Jaguar & Land Rover from the Ford, Corus** etc.

Today, the Tata Group is valued at about **403 Bn USD**, greater than the GDP of Pakistan. Thanks to the leadership of Ratan Tata.
We might fail to understand the true Ratan Tata if we possibly forget to understand him at an ordinary level. (generally failed to be noticed because of his achievements)

## 1. Simple Living & High Thinking

Ratan Tata has only a stake of about 0.83% in the Tata Sons. This was because of the common practice the Tata family followed of giving away their wealth to the Tata Trusts.
Ratan Tata's most costly purchases may include only Luxury cars and good clothes. He always preferred the habit of minimalistic living and high thinking, unlike the other famous business houses in India.

## 2. Ethics & Responsibility:

Ratan Tata was very much concerned about ethical business practices. It was this approach of this that transformed the Tata group to adopt more welfare plans in their operations.
He himself invested in businesses or start-ups, many of them were social entrepreneurial ventures.
Tata says that his later stage in life was devoted to transforming the health sector in India, thus building many Tata Cancer hospitals across the whole country.

## 3. Upbringing:

Ratan Tata had a rough childhood. He and his brother jimmy were raised up by his grandmother, post the divorce of his parents. Despite all the odds of childhood and uncomfortable instances, Ratan Tata was always compassionate, kind and humble. He was more a "Custodian" of wealth than an "Owner".
