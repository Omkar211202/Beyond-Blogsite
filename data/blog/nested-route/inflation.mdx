## General perspective

Many of us think [Inflation](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/Series/Back-to-Basics/Inflation), that is a general rise in price levels is bad for us.
Well,you are right, inflation does lead to higher costs of living.

Let me tell you another side of the story...

## Another side of the coin

Economic theory (Macro-Economics) says that **Inflation** is one of the important requisites for **Growth**.

Let me explain.

One of the reasons why suppliers increase their quantity (produced) is when they see higher prices in market.
This will lead to increase in output of goods produced in the time period, there by growth (GDP) increases.
Thus, one of the contribution for growth is inflation.

## Another perspective: The Philips Curve

The [Philips Curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/phillipscurve.asp) says that inflation and unemployment are inversely related.
Meaning higher inflation, lower unemployment.

Again inflation is a win situation.

## Do I mean to say that there should be high inflation in the country as its a stimulant of growth??

High level of inflation is certainly not advised. The lower strata has not enough purchasing power to
buy neccessities. This happens when there is huge inequality in the economy, thereby leaving about 80% of the people in trouble.

## What does the RBI/Central bank do then...

- RBI maintains the level of inflation. They usher a mild inflation, for boosting growth.
- They follow the the [Taylor's rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taylorsrule.asp) for setting the levels between which inflation should be contained.
- In India, CPI / Inflation will be contained between 4 Â± 2%.

## How can you control inflation?

- [x] Inflation is an outcome of excess money in an economy. To curtail inflation, you gotta reduce the Money supply(M3).
- [x] Sell govt securities,[Increase Repos and reverse repo](https://cleartax.in/s/repo-rate). In this way, the central bank will suck out the money/liquidity from the economy.

## Just think BEYOND.

As explained there will be tradeoff between no price rise and employment. What is important:

No inflation or employment?

Refer to the Philips curve.

So should the RBI like the FED, monitor and control unemployment levels in the economy.

Waiting for opinions and views...
