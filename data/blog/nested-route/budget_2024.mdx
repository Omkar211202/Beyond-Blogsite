### 2. Taxation and Finance

Middle class salaried individuals loose their incentive to save as the govt. pushes for a new tax regime.
Even when they invest into the Equities and Real estate as investments, they will have to shell out more taxes as the indexation benefits are withdrawn and slab rates on CGs increased.
The budget seems to provide a negligible relief in the form of increased Standard deduction....Only for a new tax regime.
However, there seems to be a push on the employment side without giving out the freebies.

- Standard Deduction for employees increased from Rs 50000 to 75000.
- Change in the tax structure under the New Regime.
- CEA assummes that growth rate at 6.5 - 7 % for FY-25,but FCI predicts 8%
- Fiscal deficit for FY 24 at 4.9% of GDP.
- Changes in slab rates for new tax regime and indexation benefit on LTCG from Immovable property has been removed.
- LTCG for equity and immovable property rationalised to 12.5% from 10% and 20% respectively.
- STT on Equity F&O has been increased.
- Angel Tax removed.
