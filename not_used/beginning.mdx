# Why Blogging??

You might think why write blogs in the first hand?? Leave thinking about where you write and when you write..
Well let me tell you that its important for each one of us to express our views and ideas, a good way to do is to write blogs and post it.
In the process, Your views reach people, ordinary and extra-ordinary. They themselves may agree or argue on your views. In both ways, you benefit.
The influence a good blogger gets in always underestimated.

## Where to write blogs??

If convinced to write blogs, you might ponder where to write them.
Here are few quick, ready to write platforms:

- [Medium](https://medium.com/) - A platform to read and write blogs on all topics
- [Substack](https://substack.com/) - another platform to build yourself as a blogger.

I however recommend not to use any of the blogging websites, incase you are programmer.
I urge each programmer to get his hands dirty and build your own blog site, like this one.
Well let me confess, I never built this alone, I used the pre-existing code of [Tails Azimuth]() and rebuilt the whole site on it.
Refer to his Git repo to understand how to build and deploy blogsites.A Huge thanks to him.

## Motivation

To build a website on my own and connect to people who are open-minded and approachable.
To understand the entire process of blogging and reader engagement.
TO build my own customised content displaying models and enhance understandability.

(NOTE: You will never be able to customise contenct incase you use medium,substack or anyother platforms.)

See the below customisation and ponder:

## An example of code embedded in a blog.

```bash
npm start
# or
npm run dev
```

Like this you will be able to display Images in the middle of the blog, you embed links in the content and customise it however you want.
Thats why write blogs on your ownsite.

Bye...Thats the end.
